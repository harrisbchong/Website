# Personal Website
My first personal <a href="https://harrisbchong.github.io/">website</a>.

You can learn more about me, my projects, and my experiences here.

# Process
This website was created with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> using create-react-app mostly because I wanted to learn React and JavaScript. I also used some HTML and CSS to polish my skills from other projects and learn new things as well. Some of the key components I was able to utilize from React were useState and useEffect and <a href ="https://reactrouter.com/">React Router</a>. React Router was challenging but fun to learn and setup pages/page navigation using things like Link, HashRouter, and Route. Another skill that I was able to really improve on as well was my CSS/HTML. Prior to this project, I had very basic level experience, but during this project I was able to explore a lot of different new features like a video tag in order to actually be able to design and format something aesthetically pleasing.
